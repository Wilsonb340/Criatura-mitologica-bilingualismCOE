            <h2 class="section-title">Characteristics</h2>
            <p class="section-description">The Dracoceronte combines elements of both creatures in its appearance. It has the stout body and scaly skin of a dragon, adorned with backward-curving horns and a long, spiky tail. However, its head features distinctive features of a rhinoceros, such as a huge central horn and a powerful jaw. Their eyes glow with a mystical glow, and their coloration ranges from dark tones to a mix of green and brown. Besides, it is known for its fierce and territorial nature. He possesses impressive strength and amazing stamina, making him a formidable opponent. Despite its intimidating appearance, this mythological animal is intelligent and possesses ancient wisdom.</p>
